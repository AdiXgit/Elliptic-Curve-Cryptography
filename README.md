# Elliptic Curve Cryptography
This project aims to implement basic Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) , providing to a better alternative compared to RSA (STILL BUILDING :| )
## Description
- ECC is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory.
- It can be used tp create faster , smaller and more efficent cryptographic keys.
- This repo aims to implement the fundamental aspects of ECC.

## PREREQUISITES
- GCC compiler
