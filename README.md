## Overview

Welcome to the **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** project! This project implements a basic ECC library in C, providing functionalities for key generation, digital signatures (ECDSA), and point operations on elliptic curves. ECC is a powerful cryptographic technique that offers strong security with smaller key sizes compared to traditional methods.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generate public and private key pairs using elliptic curves.
- **Digital Signatures**: Sign messages and verify signatures using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
- **Point Operations**: Perform addition and multiplication of points on elliptic curves.
- **Customizable Curves**: Define your own elliptic curves with parameters \(a\), \(b\), and \(p\).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **GCC**: Ensure you have GCC installed on your system. You can install it using the following commands:

  - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential
    ```

  - **Fedora**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++
    ```

  - **macOS**:
    ```bash
    brew install gcc
    ```

  - **Windows**: Use MinGW or WSL to install GCC.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecc_project.git
   cd ecc_project/src
   ```
